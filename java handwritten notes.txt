Git- Git is open source tool that  based on version control system VCS ,2005 . Git is software which runs on command line . It stores locally in your computer. 
GitHub - It is a cloud based plateform(server) that hosts git repositories.microsoft ,2008.

git commands- git init (converts working directory into repository directory).
              git status
              git add  or git add * or git add .
              git commit -m "message"
              git log (history)
              git clone "local host url"
              git clone url(on server)
              git push
git init---> git status--> git add .---> git commit -m ""---> paste url(new)/skip(once done) --->git remote -v---> git push



Some MYSQL commands - create database database_name;
                      use database database_name;
                      create table table_name(name varchar(100), email varchar(200);
                      show databases;
                      use database;
                      desc table_name;
                      select * from table_name;
                      update table_name set column_1=?,where column_2=?;
Align code- shift+ ctrl+ f
                  
                 





RESTAPI-Representational state transfer  



History of java: James gosling & team. Now owned by oracle.
OOPs in java : relate real world things(object)  with java programming language.
version: javac 22.0.1

Constructor is like a function that calls automatically when object assigns.
This keyword means current class. this keyword never be called in class or function.

Inheritence:

 Single inheritence - one parent and one child
multilevel inheritence - A -B -C 
Hierarchial inheritence - 
multiple [ through interfaces]
hybrid   [ through interfaces]


Interfaces - it is like todo list.means we define all methods in interface and their body must  is in class.
method overloading - same method name but different arguments.

                              
                         
Method overriding rules- must have inheritence(extends)
                         Same function name 
                         same argument pass

super keyword- when we call method inside child class to  inherit the parent class properties..


Exception Handling: unexpected results.
Try catch use to handle errors.
Finally - it runs in both cases either any exception or not.

throw-forcefully send to catch block.(intentionally mistakes)
throws-sends in catch block on occurence of errors (accidental mistakes)


JDBC drivers -javadatabase connectivity
four drivers-jdbc,native,think, network protocol driver.

MVC Architecture - Model view controller(model means database)
                    database --->servlet ----> view
Servlet runs on server.
post means sending something.
Server- a server is hardware or software that processes requests sent over a network and replies to them. a client is the device that submits a request and waits for a response from the server.
communication between two servers by the help of api.Or btween client and server.
Json-java script object notation.
JSP- java server page is used to send the data to the html and used to receive also .



More about JDBC - Steps for Db Connection

                  load and register driver- Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
                  create connection - Connection conn=DriverManager.getConnection("url","username","password");
                  create statement  - PreparedStatement ps= con.prepareStatement("sqlquery");
                  execute sql statement- ps.executeQuery();//select query
                                         ps.executeUpdate();//Crud

                  process the result - ps.close();

                  close connection - con.close();




About Servlet & JSP- 

Servlet-Servlet is server side technology which is used to handle the client request , process the request and generate dynamic response.
Server is two types 1] webserver 2] Application server

Hierarchy - Servlet---->GenericServlet---->HTTPServlet
 
 Servlet(interface)-It defines servlet life cycle methods.
 GenericServlet(class)- When we want to create protocol independent servlet & no req-res methods.                  
 HTTPServlet(class) - It is most used when we want http specific methods & request-response object.Http methods like get,post,put,delete,head.

Note- all above servlets are defined in jakarta package.

Servlet life cycle-
1] loading & instantiation means MyServlet file will compiled and .class file will be created and then this .class file will be loaded in the Memory.When server is started , servlet class is loaded and servlet object is created.
2]Initialization-init()method.
3] Request handling-service()method it will handle the client request. IN this phase service method will be invoked.
4] Destroy -destroy()method.When the server is shut down , destroy method will be executed & servlet obj will be deleted.


Web.xml: also known as "deployment descripter" file. Servlet Mapping is done in web.xml  .On the per client request to execute servlet file it executes that servlet in server .it is done by the help of web.xml.   
         We create web.xml file in WEB-INF folder. 
   
  NOte- In latest version , it is not compulsory to create web.xml file.                               

Diffrent tasks of web.xml file:
 1] Servlet configuration
 2] JSP File Configuration
 3] Filter configurations
 4] Listener config
 5] error page config
 6] welcome file config

HTTP methods GET and POST-http methods define the specific actions that can be performed on the resources like java or servlet file , Image file,Documnent file.GET=doGet(-,-).Bydefault get is invoked.

                          get method sends data through the resource url and thus it is not secured. get is slightly faster.send very less data.It always return in object we need to typecast for string.
                          post method sends data through the http message body and thus it is more securd. post is slightly slow.send huge data (no restriction).POST=doPost(-,-).

sendRedirect()method is used to redirect the response to another resource(i.e to servlet/url or JSP or html etc)
It is method of HttpServletResponse.

RequestDispatcher interface is used to dispatch the request to another resource (Servlet or jsp or html within same application). It does not change url.


HttpSession Management-It is used to maintain data consistency. BY creating session obj.


                        1] HttpSession hs=req.getSession();
                        2] hs.setAttribute("key",value);
                        3] Object obj =hs.getAttribute("key");
             optional   4] hs.invalidate();    // to delete complete session
                           hs.removeAttribute("key");   // to delele one key value in session

Different ways to delete session object : using invalidate method
                                          closing the browser
                                          using web.xml file


JSP- Need of Jsp-->It is difficult to create dynamic web pages using servlet . By this reason jsp is introduced.Before jsp ,servlet is used for both frontend and backend code.JSP is advanced version of servlet technology.
                   Both jsp & servlet are server side technology but jsp is mainly used for frontend and servlet is used for backend.Jsp is bydefault html page and servlet is bydefault java page.
                   It is easier to code in jsp compared to servlets.JSP runs slower than servlet as it takes time to compile the program and convert into servlets.JSP can only accept HTTP requests.

JSP life cycle- 1] Translation:  jsp-->servlet
                2] Compilation:  servlet--> .class
                3] Loading & Instatiation 
                       - .class file is loaded on server & object is created
                4] Initialization : Object is intialized that created .
                        jspInit() method
                5] Request Handling  
                         Service(), doGet()
                         _jspService()  
                6] Destroy- object is deleted that created
                       destroy()
                       jspDestroy()       

JSP tags- 1] Scripting tags-are used to embed java code within the jsp page.  <% ---%> 
 
              i]   Sciptlet tag-variables,print,if-else,forloop,logics,database connectivity etc    <%  -- %>
              ii]  Declarations tag- used to declare variables & methods  <%!--%>
              iii] Expression tag- used to evaluate an expression,print,etc     <%= -- %>

          2] Directive tags- are used to provide instructions or directives to the jsp container on how to handle the jsp page during compilation and execution.  <%@ ----%>
                 
              i]   Page Directive      <%@  page attribute="value"%>
              ii]  Include Directive   <%@ include file="resource"%>
             iii]  Taglib directive    <%@ taglib uri=""  prefix=""%>


          3] Action tags- are used to perform specific actions or operations within the jsp page . Action tags provide a way to inteact with java objects,control flow, and perform actions like forwarding including other resources and manipulating session attributes.<jsp:-    />

               i] include tags             <jsp: include--/>
               ii] forward tag             <jsp:forward--/>
               iii] Beans action tags      <jsp.getProperty-/>,etc

JSP imlicit objects- JSP implicit objects are predefined variables that are available for use without any explicit declaration or initialization . These objects are automatically created by jsp container and provide access to various functionalities and information related to jsp page , request , session , application , and more.

JSP 9 impicit objects- request , response , out,session, application,config,pagecontext,page,exception.

Expression language-      ${-expression-} like ${param.name1},${10+25},etc

 EL is a simplified language that is used to access and manipulate 
data within jsp pages. It provides a convenient way to access the data stored in the objects
like request,session,application ,java bean component etc.
